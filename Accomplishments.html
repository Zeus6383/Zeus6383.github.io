            My accomplishments in the technology field are quite impressive, particularly in terms of troubleshooting. Electronics inevitably encounter issues, and as mentioned in my "About Me" section, my greatest struggle with technology stemmed from network issues. Linking back to my gaming hobby, whenever I tried to play games like Call of Duty with friends, I encountered problems with restrictive ports. At the time, this was frustrating, but I wasn't going to let some issue get in the way of having a great gaming night with the boys! So, with my affinity for technology, I turned to the web to learn how to port forward. A couple of hours later, I fixed my issue and also gained an understanding of how DNS servers work. In the process of port forwarding, I ended up speeding up our internet, thanks to Google’s and Cloudflare’s DNS. Keep in mind that I achieved this at a young age without a dedicated instructor.

            Other feats I've accomplished are more related to Android phones. I've successfully rooted them in the past to unlock full developer controls. I did this out of curiosity and the desire to have more control over my personal device. With this knowledge, I've fixed countless phone-related issues for my grandparents, parents, and other relatives. The countless hours spent on Google Meet troubleshooting phone issues gave me the experience of what it would be like to be a technical support operator.

            Apart from technical accomplishments, I'd also like to highlight my gaming achievements. It isn't just about getting a high kill streak in COD; it's much bigger than that. During my junior year of high school, I joined an Overwatch gaming club, and what I thought would be casual gaming turned into something more significant. I discovered that I was quite skilled at the game, and with that skill, I made it onto the competitive school team. We spent months training on teamwork, mechanical skill, and overall quick problem-solving and planning. At the time, I didn't expect us to go as far as we did, but in the end, my team and I not only reached the state finals but won! The feeling to this day remains unmatched. This journey taught me the importance of communication with others and emphasized that a team is only as good as the bonds they share. This lesson is applicable to various aspects of life, such as a job in IT, which requires communication skills to tackle significant goals.
