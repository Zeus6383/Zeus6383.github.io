  <h2>Welcome to my webpage!</h2>
    <p>I hope you can navaigte between everything well! The purpose of this site is
    for you to learn and understand more about me. Below are the site goals:</p>

  <a>
    I'm Owen Laycock, and technology has been a lifelong fascination for me. Its impact extends not only to my personal
    journey but also to those within my sphere of influence. My primary pursuit involves unraveling the intricate web of
    the internet, a subject that never ceases to intrigue me.
  </a>

  <P>
    Networking became a particular focus due to my avid interest in gaming, where the frustrations of network-related
    issues are all too familiar to me and others alike. I began exploring concepts like port forwarding, network
    security, and subnets well before my fourteenth birthday after being given a gaming computer with network issues.
    It's a bit of a mystery why I have such a strong affinity for technology, but it's something that comes naturally to
    me. Maybe these skill sets are from a past life or maybe they are skills acquired for a greater destiny.
  </P>

  <P>While some might speculate that my loving family played a role in shaping my interests,
    I must clarify that none of my family members share my specific passion for technology. Nevertheless, I am convinced
    that my purpose lies in advancing technology and fostering connectivity among individuals through the internet and
    electronic devices. After having helped my grandpa understand how to use a modern phone and seeing him advance and
    connect ever so deep with it I have come to the conclusion that Technology is great! These tools possess a
    captivating quality that can not only bridge gaps in geographical distances but they also contain the ability to
    propel the human race eons forward.
  </p>
